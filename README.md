## Game Proposal ##

Write a paragraph here describing the game you want to make.  Describe how it is played and which features
you want to include in your game.  Remember, any simple game can be scaled up with features and any complex
game can be scaled down.

I am making a basketball shootout game where there are five spots a player has to shoot from. In order to win, a player must shoot a certain percentage in total or in 
other words make a certain shots out of 25. There are five spots and five shots at each spot. In addition to that, there will a money rack where each made shot
there will be 2 points instead of once. Also on the last rack, the rim will start moving side to side to make it harder. The player's distance from the circular
rim will not change throughout the whole game. The player shoots by trying to get a space bar in a moving region. Getting in the green is better for odds.


Game Controls:
space bar to click and arrow keys to switch racks

space bar that 

Game Elements:

a player, balls , racks , and the hoop

How to Win:

achieve a score of 18/25

## Teacher Response ##

**Approved**

This game is harder than you might think.  Your main challenges will be:

 - Getting the ball to look like it's being thrown.  This depends on the ange/perspective you're going to have for the scene.  If you just make the ball travel in a straight line with constant speed, that's NOT really a basketball game.
 - Detecting whether a shot has been made is more than just detecting when the hoop sprite touches the ball.  Otherwise you could hit the side of the hoop and score.  So you need a way to know if the ball is actually in the hoop.

Everything else after these challenges will be easy.

## Class Design and Brainstorm ##

Basically, my initial idea was to create different spots but that became too complicated so my plan was to break my game down into 3 parts, the meter, and the hoop.

**Date 5/29 (2 hours)**

Goal:  I have to create all my classes and update my interfaces to better fit my work

Work accomplished:  I created my classes but there are a lot of errors in my code that I need to fix.

**Date 5/30 (2 hours)**

Goal:  Today I want to add all the logic to my code and hopefully get that put to work.

Work accomplished:  Today I got most of my logic down in all of the classes but my images are not done and my stage doesnt work 

Date 5/31 (5 hours)
Goal : Finish my image editing and get my stage to work
Work Accomplished : My stage works but the ball won't move which is because of the focus.
